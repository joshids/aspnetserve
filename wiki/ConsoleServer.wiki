= Introduction =

Creating an embedded server using aspNETserve involves only a few lines of code.


=== Sample 1 ===

Sample 1 is perhaps the simplist of console web servers. This particular server is so simple because it does not accept user inputs for its configurations, those are simply hard coded.

{{{
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using aspNETserve;

namespace ConsoleWebServer {
    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            string physicalPath = "c:\\wwwroot";
            int port = 8080;
            using (Server s = new Server(new System.Net.IPAddress(new byte[] { 127, 0, 0, 1 }), "/", physicalPath, port)) {
                s.Start();
                Console.WriteLine("Press any key to stop the server");
                Console.ReadKey();
                s.Stop();
            }
        }
    }
}
}}}

The server object is the core component for any embedded server. It is this object that represents the instance of aspNETserve hosted within your own application.
