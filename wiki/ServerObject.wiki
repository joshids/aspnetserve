The Server object represents an instance of aspNETserve.


= Details =

The Server object represents the default implementation of [http://code.google.com/p/aspnetserve/source/browse/trunk/aspNETserve/IServer.cs IServer], and interface which represents the following actions:
{{{
        void Start();
        void Stop();
        ServerStatus Status { get; }

}}}

All implementations of [http://code.google.com/p/aspnetserve/source/browse/trunk/aspNETserve/IServer.cs IServer] are responsible for opening and listening on their preconfigured ports on the Start command, and disposing those resources upon the Stop command.
